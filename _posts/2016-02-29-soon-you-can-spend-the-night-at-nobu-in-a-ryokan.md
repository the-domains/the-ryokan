description: "This past spring, construction started on a small structure on Malibu's photogenic Pacific Coast Highway, just a few yards from the sprawling Nobu Malibu sushi restaurant. Previously hidden away in a small shopping village in Malibu, Nobu had recently expanded into an ultra modern, bleached-wood structure on PCH with an outdoor dining terrace that runs the length of the restaurant, offering well-heeled sushi lovers and sake swillers unobstructed ocean views."
